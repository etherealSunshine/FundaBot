 "thrillers? for example?",
 
 "Zodiac's one of my favorite movies.",
  
 "Zodiac the movie about a serial killer from the '60s or '70s, around there.",
 
 "Zodiac? oh wow ok, what do you like about that movie",
     
 "And I just think serial killers, in general, are interesting, so the movie was really good. And it was just neat to see that world. Like it went really in-depth. It was like almost 3 hours long, so you got to really feel like you were a part of that world and time period. And see what the detectives and the police did and the investigators.", 
     
 "so you feel like you were part of that world ?",
 
 "Yeah. It was really an immersive movie.",
 
 "if you were in the movie what character do you feel most relatable",
 
 "Probably the main character, Robert Graysmith, just cuz he's awkward and bumbly. So, I guess that's the one I would be the closest to.",
 
 "ok nice, any other similiar movies you have seen recently?",
  
 "Not that I can think of.",
   
 "how about different type of movies like Once Upon a Deadpool",
   
 "I haven't seen that.",
 
 "have you heard of that movie",
  
 "I've heard of it, but I haven't seen it.",
     
 "would you be interested to watch it",
 
 "Not particularly. I don't really like comic book movies that much. But I really wanted to see Deadpool, so I'd probably be more willing to watch that than most comic book movies.",
 
 "I'd probably be more willing to watch that than most comic book movies",
      
 "I really wanted to see Deadpool",
     
 "oh what makes deadpool different than the others?",
  
 "I don't know. It just seems a unique concept and different, not just the standard superhero movie.",
     
 "not just the standard superhero movie",
 
 "And it's more of a comedy, so that's unique.",
   
 "ok so you enjoy comedy as well, correct?"
 
 "Yep, I think most people do.",
    
 "what type of movie you don't enjoy?",
   
 "I'm not a big action movie fan like Die Hard or like Rambo movies. I don't hate them, I just think they're boring. Like I can't watch a lot of them, or else I get sick of them.",
 
 "I don't hate them, I just think they're boring",
 
 "I can't watch a lot of them, or else I get sick of them",
 
 "what about mission impossible?",
  
 "Never seen it. I know what it is, but I haven't seen it.",
  
 "I know what it is, but I haven't seen it",
     
 "do you care who acts in the movie?",
   
 "Just in general? I'm not I'm not picky about actors. Like I won't see a movie just cuz I don't like the actor in it.",
 
 "oh ok so you dont have a favorite actor is that right"
 
 "I mean I like certain actors more than others, but I wouldn't say I have a favorite actor.",
 
 "ok who came to your mind when it comes to actors you like to see in the movie",
   
 "Tom Hanks",
   
 "Catch Me If You Can",
    
 "what so great about that movie"
   
 "It's just an interesting story and it's based on a true story and it's got Leonardo Dicaprio in it, another good actor.",
 
 "it's based on a true story",
     
 "it's got Leonardo Dicaprio in it, another good actor",
     
 "do you think that movie is exciting?",
  
 "Yep.",
 
 "which scene you find most memorable?",
  
     
 "It's been a long time since I've seen that movie. I can't think of any specific scene.",
     
 
 "what kind of movies do you generally like?",
  
     
 "I see. Why do you like that kind of movie?",
 
 "Well I like that kind of movie because you know, it'll make me laugh, and I often watch movies with my girlfriend, and I want to make sure whatever we watch, it's something we can both enjoy and and relax while watching.",
  
 "That seems really nice. Can you think of a movie you really enjoyed recently?",
 
 "Yeah, I really enjoyed The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler.",
 
 "What did you like about that movie?",
  
 "I liked the acting. It's a lot of humor and gags in the movie. It had a good pace, good pacing. The story made sense.",
  
 "Now I'd like to know what kinds of movies you dislike if that's okay?",
 
 "Good question. Not really a fan of Hallmark movies, that kind of romantic comedy. Mostly because they typically have pretty bad acting. Yeah, not for me.",
    
 "Why else don't you like those?",
 
 "Well, I guess another reason would be that the stories are all typically same or very similar. There's no",
     
 "It's just it's just very boiler plate. There's nothing There's not much new about each new Hallmark movie.",
  
 "I see. They're pretty cookie-cutter it sounds like",
 
 "That's exactly right.",
 
 "So based on what you told me, I'm curious, did you see Jurassic World?",
 
 "I have not seen Jurassic World, no.",
    
 "But I saw the original Jurassic Park",
    
 
 "What did you think of the original?", 
   
 "I liked the original a lot. Very creative movie. Very ahead of it's time with the computer generated imagery CGI.",
  
 "That's great. So if you liked the original would you consider seeing Jurassic World given the option to?",
     
 "Yeah, I would I would certainly consider it, yes.",
     
 "I don't know too much about it, but I I think I saw the commercial for it.",
     
 "What kinds of movies do you like?"
 
 "I really like comedy movies.",
